1. Observables - a proposed feature in ES2016  for managing async data
    - it treats data as an array whose items arrive asynchronously over time
    - treat events as a collection
    - it is a proposed feature for ES2016 (next version of javascript)
    - uses Reactive extensions (RxJS). Do not confuse with React

========================================
2. Angular CLI - to install npm install -g @angular/cli

========================================
3. Routing:
    - import RouterModule
    - RouterModule register's the router service
    - RouterModule declares 2 directives:
        - router-outlet
        - router-link
    - RouterModule exposes configured routes by passing the configured routes to the RouterModule in the
      in the @imports section of app.module like this:
          RouterModule.forRoot([ <--- passing an array of routes. This establishes the routes for the root of our application.
             path: ...
             path: ..
             path: ...
          ])
    - define base element -  base: /href in the host module - ex app.module.ts
    - define the menu in the app.component.ts using a list and the router-link directive
      (see app.component.ts)
    - place the router-outlet directive to the host module ex. app.comonent.ts


    - passing parameters to route by adding router-link to anchor tag (see... product-list-component.html)
        - to read the parameters we need to import ActivatedRoute service from @angular/Router
        - the retrieve a parameter we can use two methods:
            -  _route.Snapshot.paramMap.Get('parm name')  - use this if you want the initial value of the parameter
            - Observables -but  if you expect the parameter to change without leaving the page
               (for example if the page has a next button, the url will change because it will
               display the next product) then use Observables

        - to route programmtically:
            - need to import and use "Router service" like this: (see product-detail.component.ts)
               import {Router}  from @Angular/router
               constructor (private _router: Router) 

    - protecting Routes with Guards
        - create a guard class (see product-guard.service)
        - guard must b registered at the app.module level (see app.module.ts for the technique in implementing guard)

4. Angular Module:

========================================
5. Building Testing and Deploying With CLI:
  - "ng serve o" the o automaticall opens the application in a browser. put these changes in package.json
